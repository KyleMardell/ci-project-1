# Garden Collective

The Garden Collective website is aimed at gardening enthusiasts looking to join a local gardening club. The landing page is aimed at gardeners looking for more information or to join the club. The club encourages people of all ages to get into gardening by growing their own fruit and veg at the allotment the club is based on.

Users of the Garden Collective website can find information about the club, how it is run, who is welcome and club times. There is a club calendar to show which months the club is open and what fruit and veg will be planted and harvested. The site is targeted at gardening enthusiasts local to the manchester area.

## Design

### UI/UX Design

#### Colour Scheme

I chose a colour palette that reflects the content of the site, using mainly 2 of the 5 available colours to create the sites colour theme.

#### Typography

I used Google Fonts to import my chosen font for the site.

I used 2 similar 'handwritten' style fonts to fit the theme/style of the site. Both fonts used are in a sans-serif style, as when thinking about accessibility these fonts are easier to read on screens. The fonts used are named 'Handlee' and 'Patrick Hand'.

![Partick Hand Font]()

#### Content

I researched the types of produce that can be planted and harvested in a given month, and then created a draught of written content to reference when creating the site to populate info and calendar sections.

#### Images
All the images on the site were chosen to fit the theme of the site and to provide the user with a more visual representation of the club.

#### Site Mockups
I researched page layout designs to incorporate to my site and to create mockups. I then created loose design mockups of the site on mobile, tablet and desktop sized screens Finally I used the mockups when creating the page so I had a design to follow.

#### Calendar page
- The calendar page gives the user more information about what produce the club is planting and harvesting from month to month, throughout the growing season
- This section gives the user further information about what produce the club grows and what they can expect when joining a session in a particular month
- It can also be used as a calendar for home growing, displaying when each vegetable should be planted or harvested

#### Gallery page
- The gallery page displays photos of the types of produce that the club grows and what a club member can expect to see at the allotment
- It also serves to display all the images from the other pages that are not displayed on smaller devices. This means all photos can still be viewed when using a mobile device to access the site

#### Contact page
- The contact page allows the user to send a message to the club

### Fututre features to implement
- I would like to add a page that displays club memeber messages, feedback and reviews. This feature would be used to show positive messages from club members and would serve to attract new memebers to the club
