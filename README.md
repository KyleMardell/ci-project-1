# Garden Collective

The Garden Collective website is aimed at gardening enthusiasts looking to join a local gardening club. The landing page is aimed at gardeners looking for more information or to join the club. The club encourages people of all ages to get into gardening by growing their own fruit and veg at the allotment the club is based on.

Users of the Garden Collective website can find information about the club, how it is run, who is welcome and club times. There is a club calendar to show which months the club is open and what fruit and veg will be planted and harvested. The site is targeted at gardening enthusiasts local to the manchester area.

The deployed site can be found [here](https://kylemardell.github.io/garden-collective/)

## Design

### UI/UX Design

#### Colour Scheme

I chose a colour palette that reflects the content of the site, using mainly 2 of the 5 available colours to create the sites colour theme. As the site is about gardening I wanted to use a colour pallete incorporating greens and yellows.

#### Typography

I used Google Fonts to import my chosen font for the site.

I used 2 similar 'handwritten' style fonts to fit the theme/style of the site. Both fonts used are in a sans-serif style, as when thinking about accessibility these fonts are easier to read on screens. The fonts used are named 'Handlee' and 'Patrick Hand'.

#### Content

I researched the types of produce that can be planted and harvested in a given month, and then created a draught of written content to reference when creating the site to populate info and calendar sections.

#### Images

All the images on the site were chosen to fit the theme of the site and to provide the user with a more visual representation of the club.

#### Site Mockups

I researched page layout designs to incorporate to my site and to create mockups. I then created loose design mockups of the site on mobile, tablet and desktop sized screens Finally I used the mockups when creating the page so I had a design to follow.

## Features

The site is made up of 6 pages, 4 main site pages, a form submittion confirmation page and a 404 page.

### Existing Features

#### Favicon

- I chose a simple favicon with the letters 'GC' for 'Garden Collective' following the colour scheme of the site

![Favicon](https://github.com/KyleMardell/garden-collective/blob/main/assets/favicon/apple-touch-icon.png)

#### Navigation bar
- The navigation bar is identical on all 4 pages of the site and it fixed to the top of the screen for both consitancy and ease of use
- The nav bar is fully resposive with a drop down menu for smaller screens and a fixed page list on larger screens
- This section allows the user to easily navigate the site and see all available pages without using the browsers "back" button

![Nav Bar](https://github.com/KyleMardell/garden-collective/blob/main/media/header.png)

#### Index Page
- The index page is split into 3 sections, a hero section, info section and call to action section

##### Hero Section
- The landing page or hero section displays a large image of the clubs allotment, with a text overlay of the club location, letting the user know imediately who the site is for

![Hero Section](https://github.com/KyleMardell/garden-collective/blob/main/media/hero-section.png)

##### Info Section
- The info section gives the user all the information needed about the club and serves to attract more members
- On small devices(phone screens) the information is split into 4 text boxes, each giving different aspects of information about the club
- On larger devices, the text boxes are accompaied by a relevant image and is displayed in a grid format to make better use of screen space

![Info Section](https://github.com/KyleMardell/garden-collective/blob/main/media/info-section.png)

##### Call-To-Action Section
- The call-to-action section is a way to direct users to the contact/sign-up page
- This section displays an attractive image with with a textbox overlay. The text box contains a link to the sign-up page
- This section provides the user a quick way of navigating to the sign-up page, and the use of a call to action will further entice potential club memebers to join

#### Calendar Page
- The calendar page gives the user more information about what produce the club is planting and harvesting from month to month, throughout the growing season
- This section gives the user further information about what produce the club grows and what they can expect when joining a session in a particular month
- It can also be used as a calendar for home growing, displaying when each vegetable should be planted or harvested

![Calendar Page](https://github.com/KyleMardell/garden-collective/blob/main/media/calander-section.png)

#### Gallery Page
- The gallery page displays photos of the types of produce that the club grows and what a club member can expect to see at the allotment
- It also serves to display all the images from the other pages that are not displayed on smaller devices. This means all photos can still be viewed when using a mobile device to access the site

#### Contact Page
- The contact page allows the user to send a message to the club
- It also serves as a way for potential members to display an interest in joining the club. On the contact page there is an optional checkbox section, designed to let the club oporator easily see what type of question a user may have
- The user is required to submit their first and second name, email adress and message in order to send in a contact form

- The page is displayed for 10 seconds to let the user know their form has been recieved
- The page redirects to the home page after the timer is up

#### 404 Page
- This page lets the user know there was an error

- The page displays an error message to let the user know something went wrong

![404 Page](https://github.com/KyleMardell/garden-collective/blob/main/media/404-page.png)

### Fututre features to implement
- I would like to add a page that displays club memeber messages, feedback and reviews. This feature would be used to show positive messages from club members and would serve to attract new memebers to the club
