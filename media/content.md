Welcome
Community Gardening Club 
Oak Green Allotments, Manchester.

Who are we?
We are a community gardening club, growing fresh flowers, fruits and vegetables. Based in Oak Green Allotments, we are a friendly green-fingered bunch who simply love gardening.

What do we do?
As a community gardening club, we mainly plant and harvest fresh fruits and vegetables throughout the spring, summer and autumn months. In the club, everyone takes care of the allotment and everyone shares the harvest. True community style.
When do we run?
We run throughout the spring, summer and autumn months, from March until October. We have club sessions on Saturday and Sunday mornings from 9 until 12, and Wednesday evenings from 6 - 8. Bring a flask of tea and some gardening gloves and come and get stuck in.
Who is welcome?
We welcome club members of all ages and backgrounds to our community garnden. We run the childrens (ages 5 - 15) club session on Saturday mornings, a session dedicated to the youing gardeners of our community, with cordial and cakes. All other sessions are open and we welcome any new community members wishing to join and help grow (and eat) some fantastic produce.
Community culture.
We want to share our love for gardening in the best way possible. As a community, we try to be friendly and helpful at all times and ask that all community members behave similarly. We ask that any community member wishing to join the harvest has also taken part in planting and/or tending. Any donations to the club are greatly welcome and go towards seees, saplings, soil and garden eqipment. We cant wait to see you at our next club. Happy gardening.
